## Documentation

 * [Rust API - Stable](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/latest/docs/pangocairo/)
 * [Rust API - Development](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/pangocairo)
 * [GTK Installation instructions](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/)

## Using

We recommend using [crates from crates.io](https://crates.io/keywords/gtk-rs),
as [demonstrated here](https://gtk-rs.org/#using).

If you want to track the bleeding edge, use the git dependency instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
pangocairo = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core.git", package = "pangocairo" }
```

Avoid mixing versioned and git crates like this:

```toml
# This will not compile
[dependencies]
pangocairo = "0.13"
pangocairo = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core.git", package = "pangocairo" }
```
