This function is guaranteed to succeed if applied to the result of [`shell_quote()`][crate::shell_quote()]. If it fails, it returns [`None`] and sets the error. The `quoted_string` need not actually contain quoted or escaped text; [`shell_unquote()`][crate::shell_unquote()] simply goes through the string and unquotes/unescapes anything that the shell would.
