The results are defined to be the same as those you would get from a UNIX98 /bin/sh, as long as the input contains none of the unsupported shell expansions.

Only handles quotes; if a string contains file globs, arithmetic operators, variables, backticks, redirections, or other special-to-the-shell features, the result will be different from the result a real shell would produce (the variables, backticks, etc. will be passed through literally instead of being expanded). This function is guaranteed to succeed if applied to the result of [`shell_quote()`][crate::shell_quote()]. If it fails, it returns [`None`] and sets the error. The `quoted_string` need not actually contain quoted or escaped text; [`shell_unquote()`][crate::shell_unquote()] simply goes through the string and unquotes/unescapes anything that the shell would.
