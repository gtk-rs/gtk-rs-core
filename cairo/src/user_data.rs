// because the value could be removed with `remove_user_data` or replaced with `set_user_data`

// (Borrowing with `&mut self` would not help as `Self` can be itself reference-counted.)
//
// Therefore the value must be reference-counted.
//
// We use `Rc` over `Arc` because the types implementing these methods are `!Send` and `!Sync`.
